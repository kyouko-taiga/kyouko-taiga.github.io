## Hello, World!

My name is Dimi Racordon.
I am a postdoctoral research at Northeastern University, USA, working with Jan Vitek in the [Programming Research Laboratory (PRL)](https://prl.ccs.neu.edu/) research group.

My research advances methods and techniques that empower developers to write expressive, efficient, and reliable software. I gravitate toward **model checking**, **formal verification**, and **programming language design**, with a particular focus on advanced **type systems**.
I compiled more information about my work and vision in a [research statement](assets/pdfs/research-statement.pdf).

I'm currently working in collaboration with Adobe's STLab on the design of a new programming language, called [Val](https://val-lang.dev), to explore the concepts of mutable value semantics and generic programming for high-level systems programming.
Besides research, I am also actively involved in software development and engineering.
Most (if not all) of my work is open source and available on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/kyouko-taiga).

### List of publications

Most of my publications are in international conferences on programming languages or model checking and their associated workshop. You'll find a selection of my recent papers below. More complete lists can be found on in my [CV](assets/pdfs/cv.pdf) or my [DBLP profile](https://dblp.org/pid/164/5675.html).

### About myself

I'm from Geneva, Switzerland.
I'm married and parent of one.
I speak French, English, and 日本語.
I also speak Swift, C/C++, Python and Javascript, almost as fluently.

I created my GitHub account during the peak of my interest in Japanese animation, thus my handle.
I have less time for this hobby now, but am still partial to the work of Shaft and Kyoto Animation.

I'm also known as *Alvae* by my friends from video games.
I'm a Starcraft 2 player.
I play Zerg, the broken race.
