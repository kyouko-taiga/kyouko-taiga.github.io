## Hello, World!

My name is Dimitri Racordon.
I am a post-doc research at University of Geneva, Swizterland, in [Didier Buchs](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3dWTmooAAAAJ)'s group.
I work on static analysis of programming languages, with a particular focus on type and memory safety.
I hope to help software developers do complex stuff with simpler and safer programs.

I dedicated my [Ph.D. dissertation](https://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:127105) to the study of memory assignment semantics in programming languages.
