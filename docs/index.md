## Hello, World!

My name is Dimitri Racordon.
I love coding, running, cheese, coffee, whisky and playing Stracraft 2, in no particular order.

I am a post-doc research at University of Geneva, Swizterland, in [Didier Buchs](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3dWTmooAAAAJ)'s group.
My work focuses on type-based approaches for memory safety.
My main research interests include type systems (obviously), language design, compiler construction and virtual machine implementations.
I dedicated my [Ph.D. dissertation](https://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:127105) to the study of memory assignment semantics in programming languages.

Besides research, I am also actively involved in software development and engineering.
Most (if not all) of my work is open source and available on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/kyouko-taiga).

### About myself

I'm from Geneva, Switzerland.
I'm a husband and father of one.
I speak French, English and 日本語.
I also speak Swift, C/C++, Python and Javascript, almost as fluently.

I created my GitHub account during the peak of my interest into Japanese animation, thus my handle.
I have less time for this hobby now, but am still partial to the work of Shaft and Kyoto Animation.

I'm also known as *Alvae* by my friends from video games.
I'm a Starcraft 2 player.
I play Zerg, the broken race.
